# Advent of Code 2020 :christmas_tree: :calendar:

This repository contains my solutions for the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) programming puzzle challenge.

I used this challenge to teach myself some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Before the challenge started, I had never written any Rust at all, and I committed my solutions as soon as they produced correct answers, with minimal dead-code/formatting cleanup, so this is **definitely not** a good example of how to program in Rust! (I apologize to any folks familiar with Rust who come across this...)

I had a lot of fun with this and I look forward to participating next year! Maybe I'll have learned a bit more Rust by then...
