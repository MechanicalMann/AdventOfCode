# Advent of Code 2020 :christmas_tree: :calendar:

This repository contains my solutions for the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) programming puzzle challenge.  I'm also using this challenge to teach myself a bit of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  If you're interested in taking part in the challenge, it's probably best if you didn't look at my solutions until you're done with a day's challenges, because they're definitely not good examples of how to program in Rust! (I apologize in advance to any folks familiar with Rust who come across this...)
