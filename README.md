# Advent of Code 2022 :christmas_tree: :calendar:

This repository contains my solutions for the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) programming puzzle challenge.

In 2020, I used this challenge to teach myself some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). When it was done, I was really intrigued by the Rust language and wanted to do more with it.  Then I barely wrote a line of Rust until the Advent of Code 2021 last year and basically had to relearn the language from scratch.  I'm not as badly screwed this year, but I haven't done a _ton_ of Rust in the meantime, so we'll see how it goes this year!

My prior years' solutions are available on the [2020](https://github.com/malorisdead/AdventOfCode/tree/2020) and [2021](https://github.com/malorisdead/AdventOfCode/tree/2021) branches in this repo.
