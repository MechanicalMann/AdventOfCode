# Advent of Code 2021 :christmas_tree: :calendar:

This repository contains my solutions for the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) programming puzzle challenge.

Last year, I used this challenge to teach myself some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). When it was done, I was really intrigued by the Rust language and wanted to do more with it. Then... well, life happened. So basically I'm starting over again. I've barely written a line of Rust since. So once again, this is **definitely not** a good example of how to program in Rust! (I apologize to any Rustaceans who come across this repo...)

My 2020 solutions are available on the [2020 branch](https://github.com/malorisdead/AdventOfCode/tree/2020) in this repo.
