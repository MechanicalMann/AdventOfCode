# Advent of Code 2023 :christmas_tree: :calendar:

This repository contains my solutions for the [2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) programming puzzle challenge.

In 2020, I used this challenge to teach myself some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  Because of that, I found out that I really enjoyed the challenge of working in such a low-level language, especially since most of my day-to-day work is in high-level Javascript/Typescript web application development.  Even though I haven't completed a challenge since then, I've returned each year to try again, and so here I am once more.  But this time, I'm closer than ever to actually using Rust in my day job, so it's even more important that I get back into it this year!

My prior years' solutions are available on the [2020](https://github.com/MechanicalMann/AdventOfCode/tree/2020), [2021](https://github.com/MechanicalMann/AdventOfCode/tree/2021), and [2022](https://github.com/MechanicalMann/AdventOfCode/tree/2022) branches in this repo.
